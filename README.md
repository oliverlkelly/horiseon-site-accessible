# Horiseon Site Accessibility Refactor

## The Task

To ensure the website is accessible for optimal usage by assistive technologies to allow those with disabilities to use the site. Additionally this will help with the sites search engine rankings on sites such as Google.

This project allowed me to learn more about the following;
- Accessibility of websites
- Semantic structure of website elements in both HTML and CSS
- The ability to take an existing site and refactor it to meet given criteria.

## Installation

This project is a webpage, and is deployed on github pages through the following link:
 https://oliverlkelly.github.io/horiseon-site-accessible/

The site can also be deployed locally by pulling the file structure to your local machine and opening the index.html file in your browser of preference.

## Usage
This project can be used as an example of accessibility practices and semantic structure. There are other components of the site that can be used for reference, such as navigation tabs that take you to different parts of the page when clicked.

## Credits
This project was done in conjunction with the University of Sydney and Trilogy Education through their collaborated full stack bootcamp program. All assets used in this project were provided directly from the affor mentioned organisations.
