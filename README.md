# Horiseon Site Accessibility Refactor

## The Task

To ensure the website is accessible for optimal usage by assistive technologies to allow those with disabilities to use the site. Additionally this will help with the sites search engine rankings on sites such as Google.
This project allowed me to learn more about the accessibility functionality of websites and the ability to take an existing site and refactor it to meet given criteria.
